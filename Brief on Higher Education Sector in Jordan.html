<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">The sector of higher education
in&nbsp;Jordan&nbsp;plays a key remarkable role in the process of
comprehensive development at various levels and areas. That is, during
the last ten years (in the reign of His Majesty King Abdullah II),
higher education in Jordan witnessed a significant progress in terms of
the diversity of study programs, patterns of teaching and learning that
control both the quality and quantity and expansion of higher education
institutions.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">In spite of the limited financial and
human resources in the kingdom, higher education lies within the
priorities of the State as of the role it plays in promoting the
economic, social and knowledgment level of the Jordanian citizen.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Higher education
in&nbsp;Jordan&nbsp;commenced by the establishment of Teachers House
'Dar Al-Mu'lemeen' in 1958, with the level of two years aiming at
preparing qualified teachers to work at the schools which belong to the
Ministry of Higher Education. Afterwards, establishment of teachers
houses has succeeded and became known as 'Teachers Institute' which
have been developed for 'Community Colleges' in the seventies. As for
university education, it commenced by the establishment of
the&nbsp;University&nbsp;of&nbsp;Jordan&nbsp;in 1962, followed by the
establishment of&nbsp;Al-Ahliyya&nbsp;Amman&nbsp;University&nbsp;in
1989 as the first private university in&nbsp;Jordan.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">His Majesty King Abdullah II has paid
a special attention to the higher education as he steered his
successive governments to shed more light on higher education and its
development. Thus, During his Majesty's reign, many public and private
universities were established, this is in addition to the foreign
universities operating in Jordan, the programs emanated from
cooperation agreements between Jordan and foreign universities and the
SSprograms of the Jordanian universities in various universities of
neighboring Arab countries.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">During the last two decades, the
sector of higher education in&nbsp;Jordan&nbsp;witnessed a prominent
development as well as progress evidenced by the increasing number of
institutions of higher education, enrolled students, faculty members,
administrative and academic members; size of expenditures and the
financial government support to this significant educational sector.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">The number of public universities as a
result has reached (10), besides (17) universities that are private,
and (51) community colleges, this is in addition to the World Islamic
Sciences and&nbsp;Education&nbsp;University. This progress in numbers
of universities accompanied by significant increase in number ofS
students enrolled to study in these universities, where the number of
enrolled students in both public and private universities is estimated
at nearly (236) thousand; (28) thousand out of the total are from Arab
or foreign nationalities. Thus, the pride created by this development
as well as progress puts us face-to-face with various challenges, the
thing which leads us to pay more efforts in order to overcome the
difficulties and obstacles stand before us, to realize a balance
between the spread of higher education and its establishment from one
side, and its level and quality from the other.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">As a result of the development that
occurred in this sector and in order to maintain the quality of higher
education, the next phase required a reconsideration of the law that
governs public and private universities as well as the higher
education. Therefore, by the issuance of the new ''Law of Higher
Education No. (23), for the year 2009'' and "The Jordanian Universities
Law No. (20), for the year 2009'', the Jordanian universities have
become more independent in managing the administrative as well as
financial matters, and by virtue of the new law, the following units
agreed to be developed within the ministry's organizational structure:</p>
<ul style="margin-top: 0px; margin-bottom: 10px;">
<li style="">The Policy Analysis and Planning Unit which assumes, by
virtue of the new law, the responsibilities of collecting data and
information on higher education sector; conducting studies in order to
support the work of Higher Education Council and many other tasks
stated in the law.</li>
<li style="">The Unified Admission Coordination Unit which assumes
the responsibility of students' admission into public universities
according to the principles approved by the Council of Higher Education.</li>
</ul>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">The ministry has paid a special
attention to higher education in order to have it at the top of our
national priorities. Attention, herein, has been mostly focused on
monitoring and evaluation of the strategy of higher education and
scientific research for the years (2007-2012) to maintain a shiny image
of higher education and scientific research, its outputs, competitive
capabilities; and to admit the largest possible number of our young
people into our Jordanian universities according to goals system that
is in line with our national goals. We can say that, despite the big
challenges that higher education faced,&nbsp;Jordan&nbsp;was capable to
realize quantitative and qualitative achievements in this sector. That
is, appropriate procedures aiming at improving its role were developed
in order to achieve a quantum leap with a high quality and to catch up
with recent developments applied by the Jordanian institutions of
higher education. All that was due to the various initiatives that
worked on limiting the power of these challenges, weakening and
processing them for the sake of realizing a comprehensive national
strategy for the sector of higher education in&nbsp;Jordan.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">The key performance indicators of the
strategy of higher education appear clearly through: percentages of (1)
males and female's enrollment into regular admission programs and
parallel programs; (2) the steady increase in faculty members; (3)
financial government support for institutions of higher education; (4)
turnout for expansion of private universities (private sector) that
aims to participate in shouldering the burden and responsibilities of
education with the public sector; (5) the Higher Education
Accreditation Commission that supervises on quality assurance at both
public and private institutions of higher education to be consistent
with the international standards; (6) updating libraries of
universities and linking all institutions of higher education to the
electronic periodicals and universities networks; (7) the Scientific
Research Support Fund that finances projects with national priorities,
offering grants for outstanding graduates, granting the outstanding
research prize, the outstanding researcher prize and the outstanding
student prize; (8) and finally accrediting the TOEFL certificate as an
admission certificate for joining master and PhD programs.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">Moreover, the ministry worked on
bridging the gap between higher education output and labor market in
order to respond to the present and future needs of qualified and
specialized cadres in various areas of knowledge; and to compensate for
the lack of natural resources in the region by creating a qualified
human resources fortified by knowledge and efficiency.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px;">All of these achievements mentioned
hereinabove helped in moving the process of comprehensive development
forward via providing an academic, psychological and social environment
supportive for creativity, excellence, innovation and talent
development in order for Jordan to assume a prominent position that is
consistent with its status and strategic location, if compared with its
capabilities and limited financial resources.</p>
<p style="margin: 0px 0px 10px; width: 1147px;">In the region as a
whole, Jordan's educational role has become so effective as of what has
been known about the high quality of its educational system, the thing
which makes it the focus of attention and admiration in the region, and
this is clearly reflected in the number of foreign students study at
the Jordanian universities which is close to 28.000 students from
around the world.</p>
